# arthrod's Skill Registry

**85 skills** — last sync `2026-05-27`. **v3.0.0**

Major restructure: families collapsed (Pi → 2 skills, Pydantic AI → 1 with `references/`,
Rust → `rust-author` + `rust-review`, Better Auth slimmed, design dials folded into `impeccable`),
new combined skills (`conejo` absorbs code-review + autofix + pr-triage-gh, `marimo` absorbs 4
marimo skills, `ml-gpu-training` absorbs CUDA setup). All design tools include a Stitch-first
mandate (`STITCH-DESIGN.md` in each design-skill folder). 13 design/UI skills folded into
`conejo-frontend/refs/` as reference docs.

## Conejo coding-philosophy family

The five `conejo-*` skills form a tightly coupled coding + PR workflow. They share two
doctrines authored once inside `conejo-code` — `references/testing-doctrine.md`
(red-green TDD) and `references/agent-dispatch.md` (the Warren Protocol: dispatch work
to crush → opencode → other agent CLIs → subagents to preserve context and get
adversarial, different-corpus opinions) — and route to each other.

| Skill | Role |
|---|---|
| **`conejo`** | Universal dispatcher/philosophy — enforces red-green TDD, stacked PRs, evidence-before-claims, context-preserving agent dispatch, the hidden-gems review doctrine, and the no-batch-review rule. Routes work to the four specialised siblings below. |
| **`conejo-code`** | Active coding loop. Holds both canonical doctrines: `references/testing-doctrine.md` (red-green-refactor, no green-without-red, no implementation without a failing test) and `references/agent-dispatch.md` (the crush/opencode/subagent dispatch ladder, adversarial review prompts, model preferences). |
| **`conejo-frontend`** | VERY STRICT UI gate. Mandates agent-browser E2E click-flows for every UI assertion; forbids tRPC calls to assert UI state (allowed only for auth/seeding). Requires a 24/7 dev server, React + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui; rejects Ant Design. Mandatory screenshot + browser-console + design-critique loop before any visible change counts as done. 13 design/UI skills live under `skills/conejo-frontend/refs/` as reference docs reached via its index — they are **not** standalone registered skills. |
| **`conejo-merge`** | Calm-implement PR handler: gate each comment individually (batch review is forbidden; the verdict ledger must reconcile), group into tasks, test/install/ship, reply with state changes. Hidden-gems doctrine: different bots = different corpora, so weird nits get more scrutiny, not less. Deep engines live under `skills/conejo-merge/refs/` (CodeRabbit CLI engine, autofix, PR triage incl. stacked-PR merge order, proud-zanahoria). |
| **`conejo-debug`** | Skeptical investigator & autonomous deep work: hunt PRs like crime scenes, interrogate CodeRabbit plans, systematic debugging protocol with multi-agent second opinions, strict TDD fixes. Slow, powerful, one clue at a time. |

> **Foundational top-level skills** — `react`, `react-best-practices`, `react-composables`,
> `layout`, and `tailwind-v4` remain registered as independent top-level skills because they are
> used well beyond frontend work and are referenced by non-frontend skill families.

### Helper scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/install-conejo-hooks.sh` | Opt-in hook installer: idempotently merges two **Claude Code** hooks into a `settings.json` (default `~/.claude/settings.json`, override with `--settings`) — a `PreToolUse(Edit|Write)` cookbook-check and a `Stop` bug-fix-learning hook. Supports `--dry-run`. Does **not** touch git hooks. |
| `scripts/sync-to-claude.sh` | Mirrors the `conejo-*` skills to `~/.claude/skills` and prunes the 13 folded design skills that now live inside `conejo-frontend/refs/`. Symlink-aware, refuses to delete locally-modified directories, supports `--dry-run` and `--root <path>`. |

## Sync

```bash
./scripts/update-skills.sh            # additive — only adds NEW skills (default, safe)
./scripts/update-skills.sh --yolo     # substitute — wipes ./skills/ and re-copies everything
DRY_RUN=1 ./scripts/update-skills.sh  # local only, no commit/push
SOURCE=/path ./scripts/update-skills.sh
```
