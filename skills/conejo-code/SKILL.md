description: Active coding loop — feature stages (brainstorm→plan→interface→tests→implement→improve→review→loop), red-green TDD execution, context-preserving agent dispatch via crush/opencode/other CLIs with subagent fallback, adversarial reviews, coding standards, bug-fix learning. Owns the canonical testing doctrine and the agent-dispatch doctrine. Use when writing or changing code (backend, logic, APIs, libraries, CLIs).

# Conejo-code — active coding

The hands-on coding loop. Philosophy lives in [[conejo]]; this skill is how you execute
it — relentless, disciplined, experiment-driven, detail-obsessed.

**Autonomy rule:** you MUST be fully autonomous. ALWAYS set a timer when waiting for
(1) the user, (2) Claude agents, (3) Claude or any other tool, or (4) opencode/crush/
forge agents. NEVER expect that a response will wake you up. Implement the original
plan, inferring the best alternatives to make it work.

## Step 0 — Resolve your dispatcher (ONCE, before the loop)

Read `references/agent-dispatch.md` (the Warren Protocol) — it is canonical. The short
version:

```bash
if   command -v crush    >/dev/null 2>&1; then DISPATCH=crush
elif command -v opencode >/dev/null 2>&1; then DISPATCH=opencode
elif command -v codex    >/dev/null 2>&1; then DISPATCH=codex
elif command -v gemini   >/dev/null 2>&1; then DISPATCH=gemini
elif command -v pi       >/dev/null 2>&1; then DISPATCH=pi
else DISPATCH=subagents; fi
```

- IF `crush` or `opencode` is available → dispatch stage work through it (templates below).
- ELIF another agent CLI is available → `<cli> --help | head -40`, find its headless
  mode (`run` / `exec` / `-p`), use it.
- ELSE → spawn subagents with your harness's Agent tool. Subagents ARE the Claude
  fallback — do the same splitting, the same parallel dispatch, the same adversarial
  prompts. A second `claude -p` adds nothing over them.
- NEVER decide "no agents available, I'll do everything inline." That torches your
  context AND forfeits the second pair of eyes.

**Why we dispatch (the two laws):** (1) context preservation — you orchestrate, they
excavate; only conclusions enter your context; (2) adversarial diversity — a different
training corpus catches what yours cannot, and a reviewer told to refute finds what an
admirer never will.

## The loop (feature stages, dispatch-annotated)

Full stage notes: `references/feature-stages.md`. UI stages (design/UIUX review) and
any visual work are owned by [[conejo-frontend]].

| # | Stage | Who | How |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Brainstorm → written spec | You (+ user) | [[brainstorming]] |
| 2 | **Spec review — adversarial** | Other-corpus agent | `$DISPATCH`; model `zai-coding-plan/glm-5.1` (smartest, slow) |
| 3 | Plan | You | `references/feature-stages.md` Stage 1 |
| 4 | **Plan review — adversarial** | Other-corpus agent | `$DISPATCH`; model `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` (a bit faster) |
| 5 | Interface (types/signatures, no impl) | You | — |
| 6 | **Write failing tests (RED)** | Dispatched agent, in a CLONE | `$DISPATCH`, deepseek — then YOU run them and verify they fail for the right reason |
| 7 | **Implement (GREEN)** | Dispatched agent, in a CLONE | `$DISPATCH`, deepseek — then YOU run the suite and verify green |
| 8 | Improve tests | You or agent | `references/auto-improve-tests.md` |
| 9 | **Code review — adversarial** | Other-corpus agent (+ [[conejo-merge]] once PR'd) | reviewer prompt must REFUTE, never admire |
| 10 | Loop | — | next feature stacks a PR on this one |

Rules that ride along:

- IF a review stage (2, 4, 9) returns only praise THEN it's a null result — re-dispatch
  with a harsher prompt or a different model. Zero credit for praise.
- IF an agent finished THEN read its conclusion/diff, NOT its transcript. Transcripts
  stay in /tmp; conclusions enter your context.
- Don't be afraid of sending several agents: split the tasks as much as possible —
  up to 20 in parallel, one discrete unit each.
- NEVER let two agents write to the same directory — clone/worktree first.
- PR over PR ALWAYS. Push. After it is at GitHub, clean their mess.
- PRESERVE your context no matter what. Other-corpus agents first (different
  perspectives); if the work must be done anyway, send YOUR agents. Don't pollute
  your context.

### Canonical dispatch commands

opencode (per-call `--model` — the corpus-diversity workhorse):

```bash
nohup opencode run "$PROMPT" \
  --model <family>/<biggest-available-version> \
  --dangerously-skip-permissions \
  --dir "$WORKDIR" \
  > /tmp/oc-$NAME.log 2>&1 &
```

crush (model comes from crush's own config):

```bash
nohup crush run -q -y --cwd "$WORKDIR" "$PROMPT" > /tmp/crush-$NAME.log 2>&1 &
```

Then set the timer and poll — NOBODY wakes you up:

```bash
sleep 60; tail -20 /tmp/oc-$NAME.log   # repeat until the done-marker appears
```

Subagent fallback (no CLI found): one discrete unit per subagent; self-contained prompt
(paths, acceptance criteria, output format); launch all independent subagents in ONE
message; worktree isolation for writers; give each reviewer a different lens
(correctness / security / performance) — perspective diversity substitutes for corpus
diversity. Full recipe: `references/agent-dispatch.md`.

## Model preferences (when the CLI takes `--model`)

| IF | THEN model |
|---|---|
| Default — spec review | `zai-coding-plan/glm-5.1` (smartest but slow) |
| Default — plan review / failing tests / implement | `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro` |
| User wants a different POV, contrarian take, "what would X say", or distrusts a single model | `minimax-coding-plan/minimax-m3` (fast M3 coding plan) |
| User is "poor" (budget-constrained, signals `cheap`/`free`/`avoid paid`) | `alibaba-coding-plan/qwen-3.7-max` — always substitute the biggest available model of the family (`qwen-3.7-max` → `qwen-4-max` if released) |
| Last resort | vanilla `minimax` |

IF swapping models for a stage THEN dispatch **2–4 agents in parallel** (one per family)
and judge: winner merges, runners-up get their best ideas grafted. Never sequentialize.

## Testing — READ FIRST

The universal red-green doctrine is canonical in `references/testing-doctrine.md`.
Backend/logic/CLI/library use `vitest`; UI behavior uses agent-browser click-flows
(see [[conejo-frontend]]). Never implement before a failing test. RED must fail for the
RIGHT reason (assertion failure, not an import error).

## Standards & helpers

- Coding standards: `references/coding-standards.md` (+ `-api-design.md`, `-testing.md`).
- Dependency hygiene (bun): `references/deps-check.md`.
- Capture bug-fix learnings: `references/bug-fix-learning.md`.
- Strengthen tests after green: `references/auto-improve-tests.md`.
- Optional auto-trigger hooks: `hooks/` — install with `scripts/install-conejo-hooks.sh`.

## Plan stress-testing (Zanahoria family)

Stress-test plans via @coderabbitai BEFORE you commit to implementation. Pick by
confidence:

- IF one plan and you want it battle-hardened → `references/zanahoria-plans` (inverted
  and re-asserted until CR produces a hardened version).
- IF torn between framings → `references/zanahoria-multi-assumptions` (2–3 parallel
  framings with deliberately shuffled assumptions, so CR gets comparative material).
- IF a multi-assumptions family needs closing → `references/zanahoria-decisions`
  (extract the load-bearing assumption, name a winner, capture an ADR, close the losers).

## Tooling

bun (not npm) · vitest (not jest, not `bun test`) · vite-plus (`vp`) for build/check · ESM only.
