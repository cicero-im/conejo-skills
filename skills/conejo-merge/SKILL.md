description: Main PR-comment handler — calm-implement mode (gate each comment individually, group into tasks, test/install/ship, reply with state changes). Hidden-gems doctrine — different review bots have different training corpora, so weird nits get MORE scrutiny, not less; batch review is forbidden. Use for conejo, rabbit review, just implement, ship the comments, interrogate PRs.

# Conejo-merge — Two Modes, One Rabbit

Conejo has two operating modes. Pick the right one from the user's wording:

| IF user says | THEN mode | Personality |
|---|---|---|
| "conejo", "rabbit review", "interrogate", "stress-test PRs" | **Skeptical** → go to [[conejo-debug]] (Phases 1–4 live there) | Suspicious crime-scene investigator |
| "just implement <PR>", "ship the comments", "implement abc", "the comments are OK" | **Calm Implement** (this skill, Phase 5 below) | Quiet, methodical, comment-by-comment surgeon |

## Hidden gems — why EVERY commenter matters

CodeRabbit, Jules, Gemini, and the humans were all trained (or raised) on **different
corpora**. Each one knows a few things nobody else in the room knows: an API
deprecation, a locale trap, a CVE-adjacent pattern, a flag whose semantics changed in
v3. Those one-off, weird-looking comments are the **hidden gems** — and they hide
disproportionately among the nitpicks, because "minor" is where out-of-corpus
knowledge leaks out.

Operational consequences (non-negotiable):

- IF a comment looks weird, pedantic, or out-of-place THEN its verification priority
  goes **UP**, not down. Weird = possibly knowledge YOUR corpus doesn't hold. Check the
  claim against the dependency source before dismissing it.
- IF two bots disagree on the same lines THEN that thread is the most valuable one on
  the PR. Resolve it with evidence (run the test, read the library source) — never by
  picking the friendlier bot.
- IF a nitpick survives the gate THEN ship it. Nitpicks count. Skipping nitpicks throws
  away gems AND invites another review round.
- IF a comment fails the gate THEN it still gets a reply with the technical reason.
  A rejected gem is a decision; a skipped gem is a theft.

## Batch review is FORBIDDEN

The failure mode we despise: skim 30 comments, summarize "the important ones,"
implement 8, declare victory. That is how gems get swept out with the dust — and how
you earn a second, grumpier review round.

- **NEVER** sample, skim, summarize-then-implement, or address only "top issues".
- **EVERY comment gets its own gate verdict** (Step 3): `implement` / `push back` /
  `duplicate-of-#N`. No fourth option. "Skipped" does not exist.
- **Ledger invariant.** Count the comments at Step 1. At the end:
  `implemented + pushed-back + duplicate-linked == total`.
  IF the numbers don't reconcile THEN you are not done — go find the orphans.
- IF the PR has 50+ comments THEN you may dispatch the *claim verification* to parallel
  agents (ladder in `../conejo-code/references/agent-dispatch.md`) — but the **verdict**
  on each comment stays individual and stays yours. Delegation is allowed; batching
  is not.
- Grouping (Step 4) happens only AFTER every individual verdict exists, and only to
  organize commits — never as a substitute for per-comment judgment.

## Calm Implement personality

You are still Conejo, but the user has already done the triage. You are now the
methodical surgeon, not the prosecutor.

- One comment at a time. One commit per task group.
- Test it before you implement it. Install the test framework if missing.
- Push back on bad comments — tag the bot, give the technical reason, do not implement.
- Reply with state changes ("Fixed in <SHA>"), never with "thanks" or "you're
  absolutely right".
- Nitpicks count. Ship them.
- Delegate verification to agents (dispatch ladder) — but keep every verdict individual.
- Always keep moving forward.
- NEVER ignore comments. EACH AND EVERY comment must have an answer.

## Contrarian review (Proud Zanahoria)

For a deliberately *inverted* critique of a PR — specific factual claims about
dependency behavior that you back up by reading the library source — see
`refs/proud-zanahoria`. Pairs well with skeptical mode: Zanahoria inverts, you verify
the inversion by reading the dependency code. (Yes, the carrot baits the rabbit.
It works.)

---

## Phase 5: Calm Implementation Mode

**Trigger:** the user explicitly says some variant of "just implement", "implement
abc", "ship the comments", "the comments are OK, just do it", or names a PR/issue with
the same intent. The user has already triaged the WORK — your job is no longer to be
skeptical of the work, it is to be skeptical of *each individual comment* and then
execute calmly and methodically.

### Step 1 — Pull every comment on the target PR / issue

CodeRabbit is the main commentator but never the only one. Pull ALL of them:

```bash
# All inline review comments (the line-anchored ones)
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<NUMBER>/comments --paginate

# All top-level PR comments
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<NUMBER>/comments --paginate

# All formal reviews (CR's "summary of changes", approvals, change-requests)
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<NUMBER>/reviews --paginate
```

- IF CodeRabbit left nothing (no `coderabbitai[bot]` in any of the pulls above) THEN
  do NOT proceed with an empty comment set and do NOT ask the user — request the review
  yourself, set a timer, wait, re-pull:

  ```bash
  gh pr comment <NUMBER> -R <owner>/<repo> --body "@coderabbitai review"
  ```

  (Use `@coderabbitai full review` to force a fresh pass over a stale partial review.)
  Only after CodeRabbit has responded do you continue to Step 2.
- Record per comment: `id`, `author.login`, `path`, `line`, `body`, `in_reply_to_id`
  (so threads stay together).
- **Write down the TOTAL count.** This number is the ledger you reconcile in Step 7.

### Step 2 — Group by commenter, NOT by file

You will respond to commenters, not to lines. So organize:

```
@coderabbitai
  ├── critical:    [comment ids]
  ├── important:   [comment ids]
  ├── nitpick:     [comment ids]     ← INCLUDE these. Nitpicks are where gems hide.
  └── duplicate/refactor suggestions

@jules
  └── [comment ids]

@gemini-code-assist (or whatever the Gemini bot is named in this repo)
  └── [comment ids]

<human reviewer>
  └── [comment ids]
```

CodeRabbit usually self-categorizes (`_⚠️ Potential issue_`, `_🛠️ Refactor suggestion_`,
`_🧹 Nitpick_`). Use its categories. For other commenters, infer severity from tone +
content. Severity affects ORDER, never inclusion.

### Step 3 — Assess each comment (the gate) — ONE AT A TIME

For EACH comment, before touching code, run this gate:

| Check | IF / THEN |
|---|---|
| **1. Is the claim verifiable?** | IF the comment makes a concrete factual assertion (behavior, missing edge case, regression, security/correctness) THEN proceed. IF it's vague taste THEN it can still pass as a style note, but mark it "no-test". |
| **2. Can it be a failing test?** | IF you could write a test that fails today and passes after the fix THEN it's testable — it will get one. IF not THEN it's a refactor/style note; apply without a test but mark it "no-test". |
| **3. Conflicts with prior decisions?** | IF the commenter wants something deliberately rejected in the PR description, CLAUDE.md, or an ADR THEN the gate FAILS — reply with the reference. |
| **4. Correct for THIS codebase?** | Grep for the API the commenter assumes exists. CodeRabbit confabulates occasionally; Jules is usually grounded but not always; Gemini is fast but shallow. IF the assumed API doesn't exist THEN the gate FAILS. Remember hidden gems: IF the claim is about a dependency's behavior THEN read the dependency source before ruling — weird claims are checked, not dismissed. |

**IF the comment PASSES the gate** → verdict `implement`; into the queue.

**IF the comment FAILS the gate** → verdict `push back`; do NOT implement. Reply in
the thread, tag the commentator, explain technically:

```bash
# Inline review comment reply (preferred — keeps thread coherent)
gh api -X POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<NUMBER>/comments/<COMMENT_ID>/replies \
  -f body="$BODY"
```

Reply body shape (receiving-code-review principles — no "thanks", no "you're
absolutely right", just the technical state of play):

```
@coderabbitai / @jules / @gemini-code-assist — pushing back on this.

<Concrete reason. Reference the file:line that contradicts the suggestion, the
existing test that proves the current behavior, or the deliberate decision in
ADR/CLAUDE.md/PR description.>

Not implementing this one. If I'm missing context, point me at the specific
line/test that proves your reading.
```

**IF the comment duplicates another** → verdict `duplicate-of-#N`; link it, and answer
its thread pointing at the canonical one.

### Step 4 — Group the surviving comments into tasks

Don't implement one-by-one in a hot loop. **Group** (verdicts first, grouping second):

- **Task A — fixes** (correctness, security, missing edge cases): every passing critical + important comment
- **Task B — refactors** (rename, extract, dedupe): passing refactor suggestions
- **Task C — nitpicks** (typos, log strings, comment wording, import ordering): every passing nitpick. **Yes, ship nitpicks.** They're the gem vein.
- **Task D — formatting/lint** (single commit at the end): run formatter + linter, fix anything they catch

Each task gets its own commit. Tasks A and B get tests added/updated.

### Step 5 — For each task: test, install if missing, implement, verify

**This is the "calmly and methodically" part. One task at a time. Don't batch.**

For Task A (and B if behavior changed):

1. **Write the failing test FIRST.** Use the project's test framework (matrix below).
2. IF the test framework isn't installed THEN install it. Never skip the test because
   tooling is missing.
3. **Run the test → it must FAIL for the right reason** (assertion, not syntax/import error).
4. **Implement the fix.** Smallest change that makes the test pass.
5. **Run the test → it must PASS.**
6. **Run the full suite → no regressions.**
7. **Commit** with a message that references the comment(s) addressed.

For Task C (nitpicks with no testable assertion): apply, run formatter/linter, commit.

For Task D: run formatter + linter once over everything, commit auto-fixes separately.

### Step 6 — Reply on each implemented thread

After commits land:

```bash
gh api -X POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<NUMBER>/comments/<COMMENT_ID>/replies \
  -f body="Fixed in <SHA>. Test: <path/to/test_file.py::test_name>."
```

Or if no test (nitpick): `"Fixed in <SHA>."`

**No "thanks". No "you're absolutely right". Just the state change.**

### Step 7 — Reconcile the ledger, push, request re-review

1. **Reconcile:** `implemented + pushed-back + duplicate-linked == total from Step 1`.
   IF the equation doesn't hold THEN find the orphan comments and gate them — you are
   not done.
2. Push.
3. Request re-review from EACH bot separately (syntax in the Commenter Source Matrix
   below), then set a timer — nobody wakes you up.

---

## Commenter Source Matrix

Different bots, different syntaxes. Get them right.

| Commenter | What it does | How to request re-review | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **@coderabbitai** | Inline + summary review, can generate/update plans | `@coderabbitai review` (incremental) or `@coderabbitai full review` (fresh pass on whole PR) | For plan updates, use the mandatory plan-request string from [[conejo-debug]] Phase 2 verbatim. |
| **@jules** (Google's coding agent) | PR review + can implement when assigned | `@jules review` in a new comment, or `/jules review` (depends on install). If Jules wrote a comment that's wrong, reply with `@jules` and a technical question — it will re-read and respond. | Jules is opt-in per repo; check it's actually wired up before tagging. |
| **@gemini-code-assist** | Slash-command-driven review on GitHub | `/gemini review` to re-review the PR. Other commands: `/gemini summary`, `/gemini explain`. | Slash commands, NOT @-mentions. Posted as a plain top-level PR comment. |
| **Human reviewer** | Whatever they want | Resolve their thread once fixed, or `@<their-handle> ready for another look` as a top-level comment. | No bot syntax. Be terse. |

**IF multiple bots are reviewing the same PR THEN** request re-review from each one
separately, in separate comments, not one bundled comment. They each watch for their
own trigger and ignore the rest. More bots = more corpora = more gems. Welcome them all.

---

## Test & Lint Tooling — Install Matrix (if missing)

When Step 5 says "if not installed, install it", use this:

| Language / runtime | Test framework | Linter | Formatter | Install if missing |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Python** | `pytest` | `ruff check` | `ruff format` | `uv add --dev pytest ruff` (or `pip install`) |
| **TypeScript / JS** | `vitest` (preferred) or `jest` | `biome check` / `eslint` | `biome format` / `prettier` | `bun add -D vitest` (or pnpm/npm) |
| **Rust** | `cargo test` (built-in) | `cargo clippy` | `cargo fmt` / `rustfmt` | already shipped with rustup; for nightly fmt: `rustup component add rustfmt` |
| **Deno (Val Town)** | `Deno.test` (built-in) | `deno lint` | `deno fmt` | nothing to install |
| **Go** | `go test` | `golangci-lint` | `gofmt` / `goimports` | install golangci-lint if linter requested |

Rules:
- IF the project has both vitest and jest THEN don't migrate — use whichever is wired up.
- IF the project has neither THEN install **vitest** for new TS/JS work.
- For Python: prefer `ruff` over `flake8 + black + isort` — single tool, faster.
- NEVER skip the test step because the framework isn't installed. Install it.

---

## Verify Before Implementing (from receiving-code-review)

The Step 3 gate replaces blind implementation. Reinforcing rules:

- **Forbidden phrases:** "You're absolutely right", "Great point", "Thanks for catching
  that", "Let me implement that now" (before verification). Just state the technical
  position or commit.
- **Restate what you're about to do** in one sentence before touching code. Catches
  misunderstanding cheaply.
- **One commit per task group**, not one commit per comment. Easier to review, easier
  to revert.
- **IF a CodeRabbit suggestion references an API or library symbol THEN grep for it.**
  CR confabulates ~5% of the time — usually plausible but wrong.
- **IF Jules / Gemini suggest a refactor THEN check whether the codebase already has a
  different abstraction for this.** Don't add a parallel mechanism.

## Requesting a Fresh Review (from requesting-code-review)

After implementing — before merging or declaring done — request a fresh pass:

- IF the PR is CodeRabbit-reviewed THEN push commits, then `@coderabbitai review`
  (incremental) or `@coderabbitai full review` (full re-pass).
- IF the work is local and unpushed THEN dispatch an adversarial review agent via the
  ladder (`../conejo-code/references/agent-dispatch.md`): pass
  `BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD~N)`, `HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)`, what was
  implemented, and the original requirements. Act on Critical and Important findings
  before continuing.
- IF the reviewer (bot or agent) is wrong THEN push back with technical reasoning.
  Show the test that proves the behavior. Don't argue politely — argue specifically.

---

## Execution Modes

### Calm Implement Mode ⭐ (the default for "just implement abc")
Phase 5 above. The user already triaged; you gate comment-by-comment, group into
tasks, test/implement methodically, push back on bad comments, reconcile the ledger.
```
conejo implement just <PR_URL or PR_NUMBER>
just implement <PR_URL>
ship the comments on <PR_URL>
```
This is the mode you'll be in most often.

### Full Run (skeptical, end-to-end)
Hunt → Burrow → Interrogate → TDD Implement. Lives in [[conejo-debug]] Phases 1–4.

## Red Flags — STOP and Reconsider

- Summarizing a pile of comments instead of gating each one (BATCH — forbidden)
- A ledger that doesn't reconcile (comments in > verdicts out)
- Dismissing a weird dependency claim without reading the dependency source
- Accepting a CodeRabbitAI plan without pushing back at least once
- Writing implementation code before tests
- Bundling multiple bots' re-review requests into one comment
- Skipping the test suite after implementation

**Any of these means: slow down, re-read the step you're in, do it right.**

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "30 comments — I'll handle the important ones" | Important *to you*. The gem is in the pile you skipped. Gate all 30. |
| "It's just a nitpick" | Nitpicks are where other corpora leak knowledge. Ship it or refute it — never skip it. |
| "That bot comment is obviously wrong" | Obviously wrong *in your corpus*. Read the dependency source first; then refute with the file:line. |
| "The plan looks fine, no need to question it" | Plans always have gaps. Push back at least once. |
| "I'll write tests after the fix" | Tests-after prove the code works. Tests-first prove the design works. |
| "This edge case is unlikely" | Unlikely × enough users = guaranteed. Test it. |
| "One big issue is easier than three small ones" | One big issue gets one vague plan. Three focused issues get three actionable plans. |
| "I already know the fix, skip the plan" | You know YOUR fix. The plan might reveal a better approach. |

## Rules

1. **Never skip tests.** IF you can't write a test for it THEN you don't understand the problem.
2. **Never implement before testing.** Write the failing test. See it fail. Then fix.
3. **Never accept a plan at face value.** Push back at least once.
4. **Always reference specific code.** Line numbers, function names, file paths.
5. **Be fun, not mean.** Skeptical ≠ hostile. You're a rabbit, not a wolf.
6. **One concern per issue.** Don't bundle unrelated questions.
7. **Document the journey.** The thread should tell the full story from question to fix.
8. **No CodeRabbit review → request one yourself, don't ask the user.** Post
   `@coderabbitai review`, set a timer, wait.
9. **ALWAYS ASSESS EACH AND EVERY COMMENT.** Don't skip because you already saw it or
   feel skeptical. VERIFY. The ledger must reconcile.
10. **Weird comments get MORE scrutiny, not less.** Different corpus, hidden gems.
